For example:

    Supported actions:
    * discover - discover resource identifiers in a web archive collection, document collection, a list of TimeMaps, or a directory containing WARCs
    * ingest - import a collection into Hypercane for further work
    * sample - provide a representative sample from a collection

    For each of these actions, you can view additional help by typing --help after the action name, for example:
    hc discover --help
