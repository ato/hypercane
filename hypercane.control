Description: Hypercane is a framework of algorithms for sampling mementos from a web archive collection.
 Hypercane is a framework for building algorithms for sampling mementos from a web archive collection. Hypercane is the entry point of the Dark and Stormy Archives (DSA) toolkit. A user can generate samples with Hypercane and then view those samples via the Web Archive Storytelling tool Raintale, thus allowing the user to automatically summarize a web archive collection as a few small samples visualized as a social media story.
